# 1️⃣ Go to your project folder
cd C:\Users\HP\Ostad_AI

# 2️⃣ Create a new Python file
ni filename.py          # Example: ni vai.py

# 3️⃣ Open file in VS Code (or Notepad) and write your code
code filename.py        # Example: code vai.py

# 4️⃣ Add the new file to Git
git add filename.py

# 5️⃣ Commit your change with a message
git commit -m "Add filename.py"

# 6️⃣ Push your changes to GitHub
git push origin main

# ✅ Done! Check your GitHub repo to confirm the file was uploaded.
Notes:

Replace filename.py with your actual file name.

Use git add . if you want to add all new or changed files at once.

If your branch name is different (like master), change the last command to:

git push origin master
